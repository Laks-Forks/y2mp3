🏇 Well, there is no contributing guide.

🎓 This project (among the other projects in my account) is meant for learning. So there is no **right** or **wrong** contribution.

👩‍💻 Just create a PR, explain what it should do and that's it.

🕵 If you do want to do more, you can add tests and make sure they pass by run `npm test`.

🤔 If you have any question about anything in the code or in the stack of this prject, please create an issue and I will do my best to help you.

Happy coding!
